## üéØ Project Goals

- Develop a custom CMS-powered website for Innopolis Lyceum.  
- Enhance the school‚Äôs online presence with a unique, user-friendly platform.  
- Attract applicants and clearly present the admission process.  
- Showcase life at the Lyceum, including staff, events, and news.  
- Enable easy content management for staff via a CMS (editable pages, news, events).

## üìÑ Project Description

Innopolis Lyceum previously lacked a dedicated website that showcased its distinct identity and helped attract new students. The Innolyceum project delivers a purpose-built, CMS-powered platform designed to express the Lyceum‚Äôs values and unique character. Designed with usability and maintainability in mind, the website enables school administrators to effortlessly update content keeping the site fresh, relevant, and welcoming for prospective students and their families.
