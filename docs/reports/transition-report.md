# Customer Meeting Summary

**Date:** 18.07.2025   
**Participants:**  
- **Customer**  
- **Developers**

---

## 1. Is the Product Complete? Which Parts Are Done and Which Aren’t Done?

- **Customer:** "What we talked about ourselves, you have done everything, right?"  
- **Developers:** "Yes. The improvement is in the mobile version. Currently, only the main page is adapted. We may need to tweak course registration too."

- **Developers:** “We added the ability to add courses, educational programs, and documents through the admin panel.”
- **Developers:** "Achievements and news can be added and will appear as cards."
- **Customer:** "This is a very important and necessary moment. It looks cool."

## 2. Is the Customer Using the Product? How Often? In What Way? If Not, Why Not?

- **Customer:** "We’re going to launch it in September. I’m going on vacation now but will be adding information so that by September it will already work."
- **Customer:** "Last year, everything was on Moodle. We had recordings, but the platform is old and difficult to manage."
- **Customer:** "For now, we’ll link to Yandex forms for course registration. Eventually, we want to automate this."

## 3. Has the Customer Deployed the Product on Their Side?

- **Developers:** "We’ll transfer your site to your server. You shouldn’t need to contact us for deployment, but just in case, we have documentation."
- **Customer:** "Yes, now we have a website. We can attach it all. That’s great."

## 4. What Measures Need to Be Taken to Fully Transition the Product?

- **Developers:** "We'll need to transfer the repository. There is a user manual written in English; we can translate it into Russian."
- **Customer:** "It would be great to have a Russian version of the manual."
- **Customer:** "Ideally, we should integrate UCASSA for payments and automate course access post-payment."

## 5. What Are the Customer’s Plans for the Product After Delivery?

- **Customer:** "We hope to continue cooperation after the handover. However, the decision will have to be discussed with the Deputy Director."
- **Customer:** "We are already planning to use the site as our main platform for student admissions and courses."
- **Developers:** "We are ready to support you after the summer, possibly under different conditions."

## 6. How to Increase the Chance That It’ll Be Useful After Final Delivery?

- **Customer:** "Ideally, a student would register, pay, and automatically get access to the course for a month. After that, they pay again to continue. We had this in Moodle, but couldn’t integrate UCASSA properly."
- **Developers:** "We can help integrate payment via UCASSA. Meanwhile, we can simplify the flow by linking to Moodle and managing access manually."

## 7. Customer Feedback on the README

- **Developers:** "There are two main tabs in the README: user/administrator use and installation/deployment instructions (Docker)."
- **Customer:** "I understand everything. For now, it’s clear. If someone technical looks into it, they’ll figure it out. But yes, a Russian version would help."

## 8. Are They Able to Launch/Deploy Using Your Instructions?

- **Customer:** "I think so. It’s just a matter of sitting down and reading. From what I saw, it’s understandable."

## 9. What Two Other Sections Would the Customer Like to See in the README?

- **Customer Suggestions:**
  1. **Russian-language version** for accessibility by non-English speakers.
  2. **Detailed deployment examples** (step-by-step instructions or walkthrough for setup on a specific server).

**Next Steps:**
- Developers to deliver final files and assist with repository handover.
- Developers to consider translating README and deployment documentation into Russian.
- Developers to support possible integration of UCASSA post-summer, if collaboration continues.
